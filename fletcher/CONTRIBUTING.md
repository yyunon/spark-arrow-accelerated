# Contributing to Fletcher

We're happy to accept contributions to the project.

## Issues / bug reports / feature requests

We use GitHub's issue tracker for any issues, bug reports and feature requests.
Please follow the issue templates on GitHub as much as you can, but if the templates
do not exactly fit your case, feel free to open one in another format.

## Code contributions

To contribute code, please open a pull request to our development branch and make
sure that the continuous integration tests pass.

## Additional platform support

If you'd like to add support for a specific FPGA platform, please set up a seperate
repository and let us know so we can link to it. We currently keep these platforms
out of the repository because they are often too complicated to integrate into our
CI pipelines. Also see the description on our platform 
[README](https://github.com/abs-tudelft/fletcher/blob/develop/platforms/README.md).

## Projects built on top of Fletcher

We're always happy to hear when people have used our framework. Please let us know! 
If your project is open, we can put a link to your project on the main README.md.

## Sponsoring

The development of Fletcher currently relies on research grants and sponsorship 
from FPGA vendors. If you'd like to sponsor the development of Fletcher, please 
send an e-mail to <j.w.peltenburg@tudelft.nl>.
