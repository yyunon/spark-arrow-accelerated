# Fletcher examples / tutorials
  * [Simple column sum example](sum/README.md) - The **"Hello, World!"** of Fletcher. Use this to get started with the 
  toolchain. Simply sums a column of integers within the Fletcher framework.
  
  * [String writer](stringwrite) - An example application that writes to a column of strings at high bandwidth.

A few "examples" (although less tutorial-like) used as integration tests may be found [here](../codegen/test/README.md).
